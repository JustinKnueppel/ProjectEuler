# Problem 935

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=935)

A square of side length $b<1$ is rolling around the inside of a larger square of side length $1$, always touching the larger square but without sliding.  
Initially the two squares share a common corner. At each step, the small square rotates clockwise about a corner that touches the large square, until another of its corners touches the large square. Here is an illustration of the first three steps for $b = \\frac5{13}$.

For some values of $b$, the small square may return to its initial position after several steps. For example, when $b = \\frac12$, this happens in $4$ steps; and for $b = \\frac5{13}$ it happens in $24$ steps.

Let $F(N)$ be the number of different values of $b$ for which the small square first returns to its initial position within at most $N$ steps. For example, $F(6) = 4$, with the corresponding $b$ values: $$\\frac12,\\quad 2 - \\sqrt 2,\\quad 2 + \\sqrt 2 - \\sqrt{2 + 4\\sqrt2},\\quad 8 - 5\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 - 3\\sqrt6,$$ the first three in $4$ steps and the last one in $6$ steps. Note that it does not matter whether the small square returns to its original **orientation**.  
Also $F(100) = 805$.

Find $F(10^8)$.
