# Problem 906

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=906)

Three friends attempt to collectively choose one of $n$ options, labeled $1,\\dots,n$, based upon their individual preferences. They choose option $i$ if for every alternative option $j$ at least two of the three friends prefer $i$ over $j$. If no such option $i$ exists they fail to reach an agreement. 

Define $P(n)$ to be the probability the three friends successfully reach an agreement and choose one option, where each of the friends' individual order of preference is given by a (possibly different) random permutation of $1,\\dots,n$. 

You are given $P(3)=17/18$ and $P(10)\\approx0.6760292265$. 

Find $P(20\\,000)$. Give your answer rounded to ten places after the decimal point.
