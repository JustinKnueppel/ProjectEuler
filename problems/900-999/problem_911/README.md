An irrational number $x$ can be uniquely expressed as a **continued fraction** $\[a\_0; a\_1,a\_2,a\_3,\\dots\]$: $$ x=a\_{0}+\\cfrac{1}{a\_1+\\cfrac{1}{a\_2+\\cfrac{1}{a\_3+{\_\\ddots}}}} $$where $a\_0$ is an integer and $a\_1,a\_2,a\_3,\\dots$ are positive integers. 

Define $k\_j(x)$ to be the **geometric mean** of $a\_1,a\_2,\\dots,a\_j$.  
That is, $k\_j(x)=(a\_1a\_2 \\cdots a\_j)^{1/j}$.  
Also define $k\_\\infty(x)=\\lim\_{j\\to \\infty} k\_j(x)$. 

Khinchin proved that **almost all** irrational numbers $x$ have the same value of $k\_\\infty(x)\\approx2.685452\\dots$ known as **Khinchin's constant**. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. 

For $n\\geq 0$ define $$\\rho\_n = \\sum\_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^n}{2^{2^i}} $$For example $\\rho\_2$, with continued fraction beginning $\[3; 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 1, 3,\\dots\]$, has $k\_\\infty(\\rho\_2)\\approx2.059767$. 

Find the geometric mean of $k\_{\\infty}(\\rho\_n)$ for $0\\leq n\\leq 50$, giving your answer rounded to six digits after the decimal point.
