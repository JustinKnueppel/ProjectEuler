Given the representation of a continued fraction $$ a\_0+ \\cfrac 1{a\_1+ \\cfrac 1{a\_2+\\cfrac 1{a\_3+\\ddots }}}= \[a\_0;a\_1,a\_2,a\_3,\\ldots\] $$

$\\alpha$ is a real number with continued fraction representation: $\\alpha = \[2;1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,\\ldots\]$  
where the number of $1$'s between each of the $2$'s are consecutive prime numbers.

$\\beta$ is another real number defined as $$ \\beta = \\frac{2\\alpha+3}{3\\alpha+2} $$

The first ten coefficients of the continued fraction of $\\beta$ are $\[0;1,5,6,16,9,1,10,16,11\]$ with sum $75$.

Find the sum of the first $10^8$ coefficients of the continued fraction of $\\beta$.
