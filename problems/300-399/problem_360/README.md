Given two points $(x\_1, y\_1, z\_1)$ and $(x\_2, y\_2, z\_2)$ in three dimensional space, the **Manhattan distance** between those points is defined as  
$|x\_1 - x\_2| + |y\_1 - y\_2| + |z\_1 - z\_2|$. 

Let $C(r)$ be a sphere with radius $r$ and center in the origin $O(0,0,0)$.  
Let $I(r)$ be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the surface of $C(r)$.  
Let $S(r)$ be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of $I(r)$ to the origin $O$. 

E.g. $S(45)=34518$. 

Find $S(10^{10})$.
