# Problem 886

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=886)

A permutation of $\\{2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$ is a rearrangement of these numbers. A *coprime permutation* is a rearrangement such that all pairs of adjacent numbers are coprime.

Let $P(n)$ be the number of coprime permutations of $\\{2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$.

For example, $P(4)=2$ as there are two coprime permutations, $(2,3,4)$ and $(4,3,2)$. You are also given $P(10)=576$.

Find $P(34)$ and give your answer modulo $83\\,456\\,729$.
