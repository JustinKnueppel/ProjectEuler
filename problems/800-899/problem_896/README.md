A contiguous range of positive integers is called a divisible range if all the integers in the range can be arranged in a row such that the $n$-th term is a multiple of $n$.  
For example, the range $\[6..9\]$ is a divisible range because we can arrange the numbers as $7,6,9,8$.  
In fact, it is the $4$th divisible range of length $4$, the first three being $\[1..4\], \[2..5\], \[3..6\]$.

Find the $36$th divisible range of length $36$.  
Give as answer the smallest number in the range.
