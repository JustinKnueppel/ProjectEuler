# Problem 818

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=818)

The SETÂ® card game is played with a pack of $81$ distinct cards. Each card has four features (Shape, Color, Number, Shading). Each feature has three different variants (e.g. Color can be red, purple, green).

A *SET* consists of three different cards such that each feature is either the same on each card or different on each card.

For a collection $C\_n$ of $n$ cards, let $S(C\_n)$ denote the number of *SET*s in $C\_n$. Then define $F(n) = \\sum\\limits\_{C\_n} S(C\_n)^4$ where $C\_n$ ranges through all collections of $n$ cards (among the $81$ cards). You are given $F(3) = 1080$ and $F(6) = 159690960$.

Find $F(12)$.
