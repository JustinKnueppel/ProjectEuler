# Problem 25

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> $F\_n = F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$, where $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 = 1$.

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$\\begin{align} F\_1 &= 1\\\\ F\_2 &= 1\\\\ F\_3 &= 2\\\\ F\_4 &= 3\\\\ F\_5 &= 5\\\\ F\_6 &= 8\\\\ F\_7 &= 13\\\\ F\_8 &= 21\\\\ F\_9 &= 34\\\\ F\_{10} &= 55\\\\ F\_{11} &= 89\\\\ F\_{12} &= 144 \\end{align}$$

The $12$th term, $F\_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
