The **blancmange curve** is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $y = \\sum \\limits\_{n = 0}^{\\infty} {\\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}$, where $s(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.

The area under the blancmange curve is equal to Â½, shown in pink in the diagram below.

Let $C$ be the circle with centre $\\left ( \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right )$ and radius $\\frac{1}{4}$, shown in black in the diagram.

What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by $C$?  
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form *0.abcdefgh*.
