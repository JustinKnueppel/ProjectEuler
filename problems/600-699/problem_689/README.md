# Problem 689

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=689)

For $0 \\le x \\lt 1$, define $d\_i(x)$ to be the $i$th digit after the binary point of the binary representation of $x$.  
For example $d\_2(0.25) = 1$, $d\_i(0.25) = 0$ for $i \\ne 2$.

Let $f(x) = \\displaystyle{\\sum\_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{d\_i(x)}{i^2}}$.

Let $p(a)$ be probability that $f(x) \\gt a$, given that $x$ is uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$.

Find $p(0.5)$. Give your answer rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point.
