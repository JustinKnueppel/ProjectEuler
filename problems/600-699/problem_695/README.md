# Problem 695

[Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=695)

Three points, $P\_1$, $P\_2$ and $P\_3$, are randomly selected within a unit square. Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of the unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three line segments $\\overline{P\_1P\_2}$, $\\overline{P\_1P\_3}$ or $\\overline{P\_2P\_3}$ (see picture below).

We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the diagonal $\\overline{P\_2P\_3}$.

Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
