# Problem 486

Let $F\_5(n)$ be the number of strings $s$ such that:

*   $s$ consists only of '0's and '1's,
*   $s$ has length at most $n$, and
*   $s$ contains a palindromic substring of length at least $5$.

For example, $F\_5(4) = 0$, $F\_5(5) = 8$, $F\_5(6) = 42$ and $F\_5(11) = 3844$.

Let $D(L)$ be the number of integers $n$ such that $5 \\le n \\le L$ and $F\_5(n)$ is divisible by $87654321$.

For example, $D(10^7) = 0$ and $D(5 \\cdot 10^9) = 51$.

Find $D(10^{18})$.
