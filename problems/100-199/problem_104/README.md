# Problem 104

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> $F\_n = F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$, where $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 = 1$.

It turns out that $F\_{541}$, which contains $113$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital (contain all the digits $1$ to $9$, but not necessarily in order). And $F\_{2749}$, which contains $575$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital.

Given that $F\_k$ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital, find $k$.
